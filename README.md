# radar_lte_spectrum

This project was born through my master's thesis to design and implement a Dynamic Spectrum Access scheme for LTE networks in 5GHz radar bands.

The NS-3 (Network Simulator-3) simulator was used to implement the Radar's spectrum environment for LTE networks. Besides, it was implemented the Cooperative Approach DSA mechanism together with other DSAs proposed in literature.

It has the source code with the following modules for NS-3:

- Radar's behavior implementation;
- Interference model for radar's spectrum access in LTE, considering interference on incumbents and secondary users;
- DFS mechanism for LTE;
- DFS-T mechanism for LTE;
- MainBeam mechanism for LTE;
- My proposed Cooperative approach DSA mechanism for LTE;
- Propagation loss model for 5GHz radio environment;
